# ‚òÅ MCT Tool

</div>

**üëã Hello there! Welcome to Multi Cloud Transfer Tool (MCT Tool), a Google Colab based Jupyter Notebook that uses Rclone & other popular engines like yt-dlp, Aria2, Libtorrent and 7-Zip etc to manipulate & tranfer data (even simultaneously) between two or more cloud services without utilizing one‚Äôs own bandwidth or system resources. Sounds awesome, right? üòé**

**But wait, there‚Äôs more! MCT Tool also saves important user session or configuration files in safe (encrypted) format to make work easier next time when user perform same task requiring same configuration or session files. No need to remember those pesky passwords or settings ever again! üôå**

**MCT Tool is powered by Rclone, one of the best command line tool for data transfer & data management. It can transfer any amount of data from/to any cloud service without breaking a sweat üí¶. It‚Äôs like having your own personal cloud assistant that does all the work for you while you sit back and relax ‚òï.**

## ‚õî NOTICE

* Never use MCT Tool for processing any illegal content ([Read official FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html)). Since Colab provides flexibility to connect own runtime or server, developers can add features which may or may not be allowed by Colab on runtimes provided by them.

* Mount points are intended only to use with Add-ons and other sections except for performing large data transfer between two or more cloud using Rclone. User should use Rclone commands with remote names to transfer larger data otherwise using mount points will consume more resources causing Colab session to crash.

* Don't execute any unknown .sh file unless you know what it going to do. MCT Tool provides option to execute custom .sh file in setup section if user decides to add more features requiring more dependencies or different environment.

* Prefer commonly used browsers (MS Edge & Chrome) to access Colab and verify your browser have javascript & pop-ups enabled else you are mostly likely going to tackle an error. Some browsers (specially MS Edge & Brave) provides additional specific content & trackers blocker, which can affect the overall working so make sure you disable it for Colab. Extensions are also capable of changing your browser behaviour and can cause same errors.

## üïπÔ∏è How to use?

<a name="htu-1"></a>

**1.Connect Google Account:**

Connecting Google Account enables MCT Tool sync configurations files between Colab's runtime and your Google Drive automatically. This makes it possible to start from where you left off instead of starting
from scratch.

<img src="https://assets.thecaduceus.eu.org/MCT/img/1.PNG" alt="1">

**OPTIONS:**
* `FORCE_REMOUNT`: Forcefully remount Google Drive. Useful if you tackle an error with mounted location.
* `CUSTOM_MOUNT_POINT`: Choose different path for mounting Google Drive. Even if you change the path, MCT Tool will automatically detect the change and hence keeping sync of configuration files unaffected.
* `DEBUG_MODE`: Enable or disable DEBUG mode. Useful to report any mount error to Google Colab team.

<a name="htu-2"></a>

**2.Setup & Configuration:**

Running setup automatically installs all dependencies required by MCT Tool and configure them as required without requiring any user effort.

**OPTIONS:**
* `INSTALL_RCLONE_FLAVOR`: Switch Rclone's release branch from stable to beta or vice-versa.
* `FORCE_SETUP`: Forcefully install Rclone by excluding all other dependencies and download them separately. Useful if any dependency (except Rclone) having temporary setup issue.

MCT Tool will automatically extract it for you in a folder making it easy to create remotes for your service accounts in Rclone.
